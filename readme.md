# project-templates

Just a placeholder for project file template files

## Overview

This repo was created out of being too busy with other things and laziness &mdash; the
hallmark of any good developer. :wink:

_Eventually_, I intend to set up a project\file template system like CookieCutter or
some other thing. I did this before using Sprout but it is no longer maintained. I may
end up creating my own just so I can get the features I want. But, at present, I'm just
too busy and lazy to focus on this as I have other projects and work I'm focusing on.

As a result, I still have a need to use some relatively "standard" files across my
projects. Things like wanting the exact same or mostly the same files in all kinds of
projects.

So, this repo will just serve as a bucket for those files. That way when I'm working on
a project I can come here and always get the most current "version" of one of these
files (as they have changed over the years).

My previous method of going back to other projects and copying files has been
problematic because when I change one of them I don't necessarily go to every project to
update it for commonality. Which means that whatever source project I choose may not
have the most current version of that file that I am copying.

## The files

The files are organized into sub-folders based on what they are and what projects they
are likely to be used in. It should largely be self-explanatory but here is a quick
description.

- base -> These are files that should be in nearly every project. Git files, readme,
  etc.
- licenses -> These are copies of the licenses I use with modifications. Pick one and
  copy it into the project folder named `license`.
